- UP NEXT:

* expand katakana list. look into way of automizing upload
* make UI friendlier
* case insensitive (just use JS)
* post on github.io etc

- FINISHED:

  - give up button (restart points)
  - make enter submit the "OK" button (forced focus arguably not great)

- BACKLOG:

* make za, ha, ba, pa, etc. work. via button? i guess so
* FIRST you want japanese word, with english typing only. So that simplifies your beta version. Don't program keyboard.
* create alternate game with matching the definition
  - with this, get definition to be an array (which would cause changes elsewhere)
* avoid duplicates
  - should probably use Set
* start a fresh git repo
