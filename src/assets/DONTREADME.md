- make za, ha, ba, pa, etc. work. via button? i guess so
- FIRST you want japanese word, with english typing only. So that simplifies your beta version. Don't program keyboard.
- Make a project map

- make enter submit the "OK" button
- expand katakana list. look into way of automizing upload
- create alternate game with matching the definition
  - with this, get definition to be an array (which would cause changes elsewhere)
- avoid duplicates
  - should probably use Set
- start a fresh git repo



- DONE give up button (restart points)
